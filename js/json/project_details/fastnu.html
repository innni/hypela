	<p class='intro'>I led a team of talented designers and developers to revamp FAST-NU's website &amp; introduce a student portal. I took the main responsibility of designing the User Interface + Experience.</p>

		<p>National University (FAST-NU) is one of the leading technical institutes of Pakistan. I was a member of The Webmasters, a student society responsible for maintaining the campus website and organizing workshops &amp; events to promote web design and development. I served as the President of this student society for two years.</p>

		<p>This final design was a result of intensive research, analysis and several design iterations. We took special care to make sure the website met the standards set by W3C.</p>

		<p>The website was officially launched on August 13, 2008 marked by a ceremony. The present version is designed and maintained by a different team (current students). It's unfortunate that I don't have more screenshots for the version our team did.</p>
