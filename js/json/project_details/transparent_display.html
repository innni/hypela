	<p class='intro'>I design interfaces &amp; creative storyboards for Transparent Display Exhibition Case, an interactive display technology for malls and museums. This is a research project being developed at U of Manitoba's Human Computer Interaction Lab.</p>

	<p>The Transparent (Optical See-Through) Display project looks at exploring/solving several unique factors of transparent displays, ranging from their design and application to usability problems.</p>

	<p>My most recent contribution is a fun animation ("6 Things You Can Do With Coffee") advertising a new mug from Starbucks. The mug is showcased inside the Exhibition Case. I did the script, illustrations and the animation from scratch. A few stills:</p>

	<p>The colors used in the illustrations are meant to demonstrate the display's color correction algorithm developed by Srikanth, one of the leading contributors to this project. This color correction algorithm reduces the impact color blending by finding alternative display color which, once mixed with the background, results in the color originally intended.</p>
