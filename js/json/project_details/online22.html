		<p class='intro'>I served as the Head of Design for Online's 22nd issue, an annual magazine published by FAST-NU. I led a team of three designers and published what's been labeled as one of the best designed issues of Online.</p>

		<p>Working as a designer for past issues gave me a very good idea about problems involved in putting together a well-designed magazine. I started by recruiting talented and dedicated/productive designers. Our design team was very small compared to previous teams but this was intentional and it worked in our favour.</p>

		<p>I created a design guide for the team to ensure each page is consistent and has the same quality. This design guide layed out rules for typography, usage of stock images, page layouts and a template with bleed, trim &amp; type dimensions.</p>

		<p>The magazine, when published, received great reviews. Quoting from the letter of appreciation I received from the university:</p>

		<p>"Ms. Hina Aman worked with dedication and devotion in giving voice to the artistic faculties of students. I am particularly delighted to recognize that Hina's contribution in giving voice to her creativity and dynamism afforded her a forum to excel in both academic and extra-curricular activities."</p>
