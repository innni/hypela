	<p class='intro'>Designed and implemented a Cardiovascular Disease Risk Assessment system as an application to NEURO-FUZ. NEURO-FUZ is neuro-fuzzy (Artifical Neural Networks + Fuzzy Logic) model/algorithm we designed based on NEFROX model using Mamdani type of fuzzy system.</p>

		<p>This was my Final Year Project at FAST-NU with two other team members. Our main contribution was not the CVD risk assessment software but the algorithm that powered this application.</p>

		<p>Our main idea was to have an intelligent system that could justify the decisions it made. NEURO-FUZ utilizes fuzzy error propagation, a supervised learning procedure and a back traversal technique to explain its results/decisions in the form of fuzzy if-then rules.</p>

		<p>The Intelligent Cardiovascular Disease Risk Assessment system helps one identify and give up certain habits to lower one's CVD risk. We trained the system with data collected from CVD patients in hospitals and referred to Framingham Heart Study for a prediction model.</p>
