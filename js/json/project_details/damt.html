<p class='intro'>Delete All My Tweets! (DAMT!) is a Java application I developed to enable users to delete all their tweets in one go.</p>

<p>Twitter doesn’t allow you to delete your tweets in bulk. Perhaps someday it will but for now, you are left at the mercy of online applications, which run extremely slow and don’t function that well. So, I came up with damt! (Delete All My Tweets), which gives you a lot more control (if you like being a geek) and is much less troublesome compared to the online tools. The only delete limitations are set by twitter.</p>
